## The combined build — two heritages, one platform

Two hackathon teams answered the same prompt and independently converged on the same five-stage method. The final-round build merges them:

| From **Team 5 — Pursuit Concierge** | From **Team 3 — Pursuit Accelerator** |
| --- | --- |
| The live streaming workspace, five engines, launcher, and one-click on-brand PPTX/DOCX exports | The Aberdeen pursuit **method**: the Client Response & Deliverable Playbook encoded as an editable skill (v0.4.0, in [`method/aberdeen-pursuit/`](method/aberdeen-pursuit/)), distilled into every engine prompt via [`lib/prompts/method.ts`](lib/prompts/method.ts) |
| Vector retrieval, anonymization, citation enforcement | The **curated pursuit corpus** discipline (point the Armory sync at the curated folder, not a general dump), benchmark scoring against a real submitted Aberdeen response (79–83%, zero fabrications), and `[NEEDS INPUT: what — owner]` flags that route human decisions instead of guessing |

What that changes in practice: requirements come back in the client's own words and order with constraints and format rules captured as mandatory rows; every win theme must pass the *could-a-competitor-write-this* test; credentials rank by closeness of analog and never stretch; deliverables are numbered and traced into the timeline; drafts follow the client's section order with protective how-we-work framing; and each tab now shows **Sources** — the Armory documents the engine actually drew on, linked to the underlying SharePoint file. What's next lives on the in-app [Roadmap](app/roadmap/page.tsx) page.

---

## Why we built this

Consulting firms typically receive attractive RFPs on tight timelines — often seven days from release to submission. In that window, a pursuit team has to:

- Read a 30–80 page RFP end to end
- Extract every requirement, evaluation criterion, and formatting rule
- Search past proposals, case studies, and credentials for the strongest evidence
- Position Aberdeen against competitors who will submit similar generic capabilities
- Draft the executive summary, approach, team, and timeline
- Format everything to the RFP's rules — federal, state, or commercial

Doing this manually consumes hours or days **before the team even starts producing the proposal**. Competitors are all working from the same starting point. The result is late nights, generic responses, and pursuits that lose on differentiation rather than merit.

**Pursuit Concierge turns that first week into a first hour.** Drop the RFP, click one button, and you get a pursuit brief and proposal starter grounded in Aberdeen's own Culture Charter, case studies, and prior proposals — with the human element leading every claim.

---

## What it does, in one hour

You upload an RFP. The concierge runs five engines in sequence, streaming results into a live workspace.

| Engine | Question it answers | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **01 · Understand** | What does this client actually need? | Opportunity Brief · Requirements Matrix with Response Actions · Compliance notes · Timeline · Questions to send back during Q&A |
| **02 · Strategize** | How do we win? | Aberdeen's Point of View · 3–4 Win Themes (each with a Human angle *and* a Technical angle) · Differentiators |
| **03 · Match** | What proves our claims? | Ranked evidence from the Armory · Requirements addressed · Gaps flagged honestly |
| **04 · Design** | What should we propose? | Solution Blueprint · Workstreams · Staffing Model · Post-award Delivery Timeline |
| **05 · Create** | How do we communicate it? | Proposal outline · First-draft prose for Executive Summary / Our Understanding / Proposed Approach · Why Aberdeen · Executive deck spec |

Every output is:

- **Grounded** — every claim about Aberdeen is backed by real content from the Armory (case studies, culture charter, services, prior proposals). No fabrication. If the Armory doesn't support a claim, the concierge says "Not evidenced" and drops it.
- **Cited** — behind every Aberdeen fact is a source document you can open.
- **Anonymized** — real client names in the Armory become descriptors like "a $1B revenue healthcare firm" in every displayed and exported output.

---

## The human element — first

Aberdeen's strongest differentiator is not our technical capabilities. It's how we work. The concierge enforces this: **the human element leads every win theme, every point of view, every Why-Aberdeen passage.** Technical differentiators support the story — they never open it.

The Culture Charter, the referral-based workforce, the Inc 5000 recognition, the low-ego / high-ownership operating posture — these appear at the top of every draft.

---

## How to use it

### 1. Drop the RFP

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/launcher.png" alt="Pursuit Concierge launcher" width="900" />
</p>

Give the pursuit a short name (something recognizable to your team), optionally give the client's real name (it will be anonymized in every output), and drop the RFP file. PDF, DOCX, or TXT — up to 40 MB. Click **Analyze Opportunity**.

### 2. Watch the workspace fill

Five tabs light up in sequence — Understand, Strategize, Match, Design, Create. Total analysis time is typically 2–6 minutes depending on RFP length. Screenshots below are from a real run against a fictional Cascadia Outdoor Brands RFP.

#### Understand — what does this client actually need?

Anonymized client descriptor, key objectives, and pain points — extracted straight from the RFP.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tab-understand.png" alt="Understand tab — client + objectives + pain points" width="960" />
</p>

Every requirement in the RFP is bucketed by category, mandatory-vs-optional, and — most importantly — the **Response Action** the pursuit team needs to take: *Address* (explain how we'd meet it), *Provide Information*, *Provide Attachment*, *Acknowledge/Confirm*, or *Deliverable if Awarded*. Definitions are inline as a legend below the table.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/requirements-matrix.png" alt="Requirements matrix with Response Action column and legend" width="960" />
</p>

Key dates and intermediate milestones are plotted along a single horizontal bar so the team can see the whole pursuit window at a glance.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/timeline-gantt.png" alt="Pursuit timeline Gantt" width="960" />
</p>

#### Strategize — how do we win?

Aberdeen's point of view opens the tab. Beneath it, 3–4 win themes each carry a **Human** angle followed by a **Technical** angle. Bullets lead with a bolded headline and a short explanation — not paragraphs. The human element always opens the argument; the technical delivery supports it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tab-strategize.png" alt="Strategize tab — win themes with Human angle first, Technical second" width="960" />
</p>

#### Match — what proves our claims?

Ranked evidence from the Armory, tied to specific requirement phrases. Real prior client names appear only as anonymized descriptors ("a large publicly traded athletic and prosthetic services company"), never as filenames or raw identifiers. Gaps are flagged honestly at the bottom.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tab-match.png" alt="Match tab — evidence map with anonymized client descriptors" width="960" />
</p>

#### Design — what should we propose?

Solution blueprint with workstreams, a staffing model sized to the RFP (with allocation percentages), and a delivery timeline.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/staffing-model.png" alt="Staffing model — roles, responsibilities, allocation percentages" width="960" />
</p>

Post-award delivery milestones plotted the same way as the pursuit window — milestone markers alternate above/below the bar so long labels don't collide.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/delivery-timeline.png" alt="Delivery timeline — post-award milestones on a single horizontal bar" width="960" />
</p>

#### Create — how do we communicate it?

A full proposal outline, plus first-draft prose for the Executive Summary, Our Understanding, and Proposed Approach — ready for a partner to red-line. The outline is intentionally reviewable by a human before drafting the sections underneath.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tab-create.png" alt="Create tab — reviewable proposal outline + first-draft sections" width="960" />
</p>

### 3. Export the deliverables

Two buttons in the workspace header. Both files land as `.pptx` and `.docx` in your Downloads folder, ready to open in Office.

#### Executive deck (.pptx)

Built in Aberdeen brand colors (Aberdeen Blue + Verdigris teal) and Poppins. Cover slide shows the opportunity name and the anonymized client descriptor — never a real name.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/export-deck-cover.png" alt="Executive deck cover slide" width="960" />
</p>

The rest of the deck follows this structure:
- Section dividers with large numbered chapter marks (`01 · Our Understanding`, `02 · Win Themes`, `03 · Relevant Experience`, `04 · Design`, `05 · The Human Element`).
- Understanding slide with 3 columns (Objectives · Pain Points · Risks) and a bottom teal chevron banner with the scope statement.
- **One slide per win theme** — Human column on the left, Technical column on the right, both with headline-and-body bullets.
- **One slide per relevant experience match** — anonymized client descriptor as the title, why-relevant paragraph, outcome callout, and requirements addressed.
- Approach slide with 3 workstream tiles.
- Human Element manifesto slide (full-bleed navy) with a pull quote from *Why Aberdeen*.
- Closer with "Low ego. High ownership. Let's build the response."

#### Proposal starter (.docx)

Executive Summary → Our Understanding → Proposed Approach → Relevant Experience → Team → Why Aberdeen → Requirements Matrix appendix with the Response Action column and legend. Aberdeen brand colors on section headers, Poppins throughout.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/export-docx-page1.png" alt="Proposal starter DOCX first page" width="640" />
</p>

Both deliverables are drop-in review-ready for a partner or practice lead. They are drafts, not final proposals — the concierge's job is to save the first four days of a seven-day pursuit.

---

## What it does *not* do

- **It does not fabricate.** If the Armory doesn't have evidence for a claim about Aberdeen, the concierge writes "Not evidenced in Armory" — not a generic-sounding boast.
- **It does not expose real client names.** All Armory content is anonymized at output. The internal Armory index still knows the real names — the pursuit team can trace back — but nothing displayed or exported names a real prior client.
- **It does not replace the pursuit team.** It replaces the first 60% of the work — reading, extracting, retrieving, structuring, drafting. Partners still shape the win narrative, edit the prose, and make the calls.

---

## The Armory

The concierge's grounding comes from the **Pursuit Armory** — a folder in Aberdeen's SharePoint that holds:

- Case studies and prior engagement descriptions
- Prior RFP responses
- Aberdeen company overview and top-client credentials
- Culture Charter and value proposition materials
- Service offerings and delivery methodologies

An admin syncs the folder once (`npm run armory:sync`); the concierge indexes the content and uses it as grounded context for every engine call. The index refreshes on demand when the Armory changes.

**Point the sync at the curated corpus, not a general document dump.** Team 3's benchmark finding was blunt: the ceiling of every output is the corpus, and a curated folder (playbooks, verified credentials with numbers, services, prior proposals) beats a large unfiltered library on every section score. Set `SHAREPOINT_ARMORY_FOLDER_PATH` to the curated pursuit-corpus folder. For a keyless local demo, `npm run armory:sync -- --from-dir ./sample-armory` indexes the bundled sample corpus (clearly-labelled invented clients and figures, safe for public demos).

## Getting it running (technical)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand: developer setup, environment variables, and deployment</summary>

### Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router · TypeScript · Tailwind 4 · shadcn/ui · Poppins
- Vercel AI Gateway routing to `anthropic/claude-opus-4-7` (orchestrator) + `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` (parallel engines) + `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (embeddings)
- Upstash Vector for embedding storage
- Microsoft Graph (application-permission client-credentials) for the SharePoint Armory
- `pptxgenjs` + `docx` for exports
- Deployed on Vercel (Fluid Compute)

### 1. Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:

```
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=…                # Vercel AI Gateway
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL=…           # Upstash Vector index (dim 1536, cosine)
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN=…
MS_GRAPH_TENANT_ID=…                # Azure AD tenant id
MS_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID=…                # Registered Azure AD app client id
MS_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET=…            # App secret
SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID=…                # {host},{siteCollectionId},{siteId}
SHAREPOINT_ARMORY_FOLDER_PATH=Pursuit Armory
```

For local demos without the SharePoint hookup, only `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` + `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_*` are strictly required; the Armory can be synced from a local folder instead.

### 2. Azure AD app (one-time)

Register a single-tenant app in Aberdeen's Azure tenant with application permission `Sites.Selected` (least privilege) or `Files.Read.All`. Grant admin consent. If using `Sites.Selected`, grant the app `read` on the specific SharePoint site via Graph's `PATCH /sites/{id}/permissions`.

### 3. Install + sync Armory

```
npm install
npm run armory:sync                             # SharePoint mode
# or, if Azure AD isn't wired up yet:
npm run armory:sync -- --from-dir ./tmp/armory-dump
# force a full re-embed (e.g., after metadata schema changes):
npm run armory:sync -- --from-dir ./tmp/armory-dump --force
```

### 4. Run locally

```
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000, drop an RFP, click **Analyze Opportunity**.

### 5. Deploy to Vercel

```
npm i -g vercel@latest
vercel link
vercel env pull
vercel --prod
```

Add the Upstash Vector integration to the Vercel project (Integrations → Add → Upstash Vector) to auto-provision `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_*` in every environment.

## Hackathon submission

This repo is Aberdeen Hackathon 2026 team **hack-team-05**'s submission.

**The prompt**

> A consulting firm receives an attractive RFP but has only seven days to respond, and its competitors are likely to submit similar credentials and generic approaches. The pursuit team needs to demonstrate that it understands the client's problem, not merely describe its capabilities. Build an AI-powered business development assistant designed to help teams rapidly create first drafts of proposals, pitch materials, and pursuit strategies.
